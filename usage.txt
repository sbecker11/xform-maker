## XForm Maker Usage

This tool allows you to define and visualize 2D transformations.

**Main Areas:**
*   Left Panel: Manage saved transformations (XForms). Select, sort, import, export, delete.
*   Center Panel: Visual viewport showing the Start (green) and End (red) states. Click background to add waypoints. Drag rectangles or waypoints to adjust.
*   Right Panel: Controls for transformation parameters (Rotation, Size, Duration, Waypoints).

**Workflow:**
1.  Adjust Rectangles: Drag the Start and End rectangles to desired positions.
2.  Set Size/Duration: Use controls in the right panel.
3.  Add Waypoints (Optional): Click in the viewport to add intermediate points. Drag waypoints to refine the path.
4.  Set Rotation: Use the X/Y/Z controls.
5.  Name XForm: Use the input field at the top-left. Switch between time-based (ATM) and manual (MEM) naming using the clock/T icons.
6.  Save XForm: Click the "Save" button (disk icon) next to the name field.
7.  Load XForm: Double-click an item in the Saved X-Forms list.
8.  Animate: Click "Play" below the viewport.

**Path Visualization:**
*   Use the "Path: ..." button below the viewport to cycle through visual styles (dotted, dashed, solid, circles, boxes, none).
*   Use console commands like `set_path_thickness(n)` to change line thickness.

**Path Interpolation Mode (Console Only):**
*   Passthrough (Default): Curve passes smoothly through all waypoints. Use `pass_thru()` or `xf("curve passthrough")`.
*   Influencer/Gravity: Waypoints act as Bezier control points (1 waypoint = Quadratic, 2 = Cubic). Curve doesn't necessarily pass through waypoints. Use `gravity()` or `xf("curve influencer")`.
*   Linear: Straight lines connect points. Use `linear()` or `xf("curve linear")`.

**File Management:**
*   Save: Saves the current state to the browser's IndexedDB.
*   Import/Export: Use buttons in the Saved X-Forms header to import/export `*.jsonl` files containing one or more XForms.

**Console Utilities:**
*   Type `help()` in the console for a list of debug commands.
*   delsel() - Delete all currently selected XForms via confirmation dialog
